# Neighborhood Map Project

## Basic Info

In this project I had to use the MVC framework, Knockout, to interact with the Google Maps and Foursquare APIs and build a functional webpage.

## Files

When the file is unzipped there should be the following files:
* **README.md**
* **index**.**html**
* **js** folder
    * **newscript.js**
    * **knockout** folder
        * **knockout-min.js**   
* **css** folder
    * **main.css**

## Running the Files

Simply open the **index**.**html** file in your browser. You can now search locations, animate markers and get Foursquare checkin data!
